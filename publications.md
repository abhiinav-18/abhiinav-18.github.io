Below are two peer-reviewed journal articles I have published:

### Journal Articles

#### Spatiotemporal distribution of air pollutants during a heat wave–induced forest fire event in Uttarakhand  
**Sharma A.**, Srivastava S., Mitra D., Singh RP. *Environmental Science and Pollution Research*, 2023, 30, 110133–110160. DOI: [10.1007/s11356-023-29906-7](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-023-29906-7) :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

This study quantifies the impact of forest-fire emissions during the April 2022 Uttarakhand heat wave. VIIRS detected a large increase in fires; TROPOMI, in-situ data, and WRF-Chem model simulations reveal significant increases in CO, NO₂, O₃, PM₂.₅, PM₁₀, and black carbon (BC) across the region.

#### Source attribution of carbon monoxide over Northern India during crop residue burning period over Punjab  
**Sharma A.**, Srivastava S., Kumar R., Mitra D. *Environmental Pollution*, 2024, 359, 124707. DOI: [10.1016/j.envpol.2024.124707](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2024.124707) :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

Using tagged-tracer simulations in WRF-Chem, this work attributes surface CO levels during the crop residue burning season in Northern India to various sources: anthropogenic (~32–49%), crop burning (~27–44%, mainly from Punjab), with breakdowns by sector for Delhi and Punjab; analyses also consider key meteorological drivers.
